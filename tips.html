      <h2>Lawn Care Tips
      </h2>      
      <div >
<p><b><em>
Don’t Over-Water Your Lawn</em></b>
<p>1.	Over-watering drowns the plant’s root.   When it rains, water fills the pore spaces pushing out air. Daily watering keeps the pore spaces filled with water instead of oxygen.  This will suffocate the roots, as plants need carbon dioxide (CO2) to live as well as water.   <b>If you have dead roots, you have dead plants!</b>
<p>2.	Over-watering contributes to groundwater pollution.  Too much water ends up washing away fertilizer that will end up becoming a pollutant.
<p>3.	Shallow rooted plants are easily stressed, which makes them more susceptible to disease and damage by insects. Minor disease and insect problems often become major lawn disasters because the lawn is shallow-rooted.

<p><b>Developing Heathy Soil for your Cary, Durham, or Raleigh Lawn
Soil</b> is the key ingredient to a healthy lawn, and having a good knowledge of what kind of soil you are working with in your lawn tends to make any garden projects go a lot smoother. The ideal soil needs a loamy texture, meaning a good balance of clay, dirt, and mud. <br><b>The pH level should be between 6.5-7.0,</b> this can be reached by adding lime or sulfur to reduce/increase acidity respectively.
Lastly, your North Carolina lawn care regimen needs to have a constant influx of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These nutrients are part of your lawn care by way fertilizer. Lawn fertilization is very important to keep a healthy lawn going, year round!
