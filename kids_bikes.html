<p >Biking around town is possibly one of the best pleasures of summer.<br>
 <p> That you’re able to hop on feeling the sun hitting your skin or the wind blowing through your hair, it turns out to be one of the most liberating moments of your day. <p> No stress in trying to find parking, no excuse in being late meeting friends, and no need to worry, nor plan around traffic. <p> Instead, you’re able to come and go as you please. 
 <p> Oh how life can be grand!  The only mishap… rain… but even that, really?<p>  Allow us to remind you of the numerous times as a child you’d run outside or refuse to come in wanting to twirl in the rain, head back, mouth open and taking in the drops on your tongue so playfully and excited.  <p>Now that is what life is about and that is what fashion should allow you to experience; forgo seriousness and allow yourself to play.
  
<h2>Cruisers.</h2>
<p> Long, low, laid back cruisers for maximum comfort, ease and stability. <p>Those bikes have what's known as a Pedal Forward design that puts the pedals more forward so your legs can extend properly for easier pedaling while keeping the seat low enough to put both feet on the ground when stopped. They come in single speed, 3 speed and 7 speed versions.</p>
